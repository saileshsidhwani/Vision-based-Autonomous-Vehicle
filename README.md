# Vision-based-Autonomous-Vehicle
An autonomous vehicle prototype using openCV and python

Driving a vehicle is essentially a subconscious task performed 
by any human merely with the use of his vision and 
intelligence.

The research in this meadow of designing 
systems to automate vehicle driving is primarily oriented 
towards using multiple cameras and 3-D sensors. But this 
approach is inconsistent with the natural behaviour of 
humans.

This project presents some of the facets of 
autonomous driving using the senses analogous to what 
humans possess - Vision and Intelligence; both artificial in 
this case.

Methodologies to implement the same are designed 
wherein a single camera when complemented by a convex 
mirror will capture an omnidirectional view of the 
surroundings, eliminating the necessity of laser sensors. 

Further, techniques are illustrated to plan the path of the 
vehicle by applying complex transform equations on the 
circular images appearing on the mirror captured by the 
camera.

A steering mechanism is designed where an assembly 
consisting of a DC motor and a potentiometer is used to plan 
and control the exact degree of rotation of the steering wheel. 

This project substantially aims at providing economical 
implementation solutions towards developing
autonomous vehicle driving control systems.
